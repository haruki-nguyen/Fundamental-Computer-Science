# Fundamental Computer Science — C Examples

A collection of small, focused C programs demonstrating core algorithms and data-structure exercises used in introductory computer science courses. Each file is a single self-contained example intended for learning and practice.

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler such as GCC (MinGW-w64 on Windows) or Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools.
- PowerShell (default shell on Windows) or any POSIX shell if using Linux/macOS.

## Build (Windows / PowerShell + GCC)

To compile a single file with GCC:

```pwsh
gcc .\add-two-numbers.c -o program.exe
.\program.exe
```

## Run

Execute the produced `.exe` from PowerShell, for example: `.\program.exe`.

## Project Goals & Usage

- Learn core algorithms and data structures through small, readable examples.
- Use the files as starting points for exercises, experiments, and modifications.

## Contributing

- Contributions are welcome: open issues for bugs or feature requests, and submit pull requests with clear descriptions.
- Keep examples small, focused, and well-documented. Add comments explaining assumptions and complexity where useful.

## Testing

There are no automated tests included. To verify behavior, compile and run individual programs and try different inputs.
